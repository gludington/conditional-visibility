- Bug fix: Add a dialog when roll pre configured skills from the character sheet (or ohers modules...) based on the current system e.g. for the system dnd5e now the two precofigured skill are 'Stealth' (Condition visible only to preception sense) and 'Perception' (A dedicated sense), in the dialog you can still choose the old generic multisystem effect 'Hidden' (condition) and 'Normal' (sense)

For moredetails check out the token configuration panel.

- Is impossibile to make the auto stealth work with other module like token action hud, LMRTFY or similar module in a multisystem enviroment, so now i just rendered the chat and hope everything is working like expected, so if no chat is been rendered on the client side no stealth effect is applied and you are force to use the token hud feature.

### 0.4.27

- Add new active effect change `ATCV.conditionLevelMinIndex` and `ATCV.conditionLevelMaxIndex` for setup range of senses and coditions, you mus use some math for get what you want.

### 0.4.15-16-17-18 [BETA READY]

- Complete rewrite of the code,api desgin pattern ecc.
- For backward compatibility and integration with the Levels module, the new logic must remain bound to the flags already existing in the current module.
- Sync the status with the flags on the token, the checking of the visibility, if I can or cannot see the certain thing is currently bound to the values of the flags, with the new version for a better management of the thing each flag is associated with an AE, so if a token a l'active effects "Truesight" can see tokens that have the "Invisibility" active effects and that they usually shouldn't see.
- Integration with the [DfFred Convenient Effects module](https://github.com/DFreds/dfreds-convenient-effects) with the will gonna be [api](https://github.com/DFreds/dfreds-convenient-effects/issues/110)
- Possible integration with perfect vision.
- Hope to have a multisystem integration, but for now PF2, DND5e are the first one requested.
- Possible integration with the [levels](https://github.com/theripper93/Levels) it's seem to be the right road to follow, we can use the method `overrideVisibilityTest(sourceToken, token){}` of levels for override the levels visibility test.
