 * Because typescript doesn't know when in the lifecycle of foundry your code runs, we have to assume that the
 * canvas is potentially not yet initialized, so it's typed as declare let canvas: Canvas | {ready: false}.
 * That's why you get errors when you try to access properties on canvas other than ready.
 * In order to get around that, you need to type guard canvas.
 * Also be aware that this will become even more important in 0.8.x because no canvas mode is being introduced there.
 * So you will need to deal with the fact that there might not be an initialized canvas at any point in time.
